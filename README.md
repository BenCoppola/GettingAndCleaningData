# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Readme

This data analysis is based on the work of Reyes-Ortiz et al. [1]  A summary of the original experiment and data collection follows.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

The original dataset has been further processed, as described in the code book.  The result is a tidy dataset which provides the following for each record:

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Its activity label. 
- A 66-feature vector with mean values of the time and frequency domain variables. 


The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.md': This file
- 'final_result.txt': A table listing the mean value of each feature, grouped by subject and activity
- 'code book.md': A description of the processing steps to create the tidy data set in final_result.txt'
- 'run_analysis.R': The R code that does the processing outlined by codebook.md

The tidy data is based on the following raw data files:
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
